# hello-world
My first repository and time honored tradition!

#updating readme text to include a short bio

Hello everyone! You can call me Xophur.
I first learned to code in 1983 in Basic on a 
Texas Instruments TI-86.  I pursued programming
all throughout school and landed my first tech
job at the now non-existent Electronic Payment 
Services in the MAC ATM Control Center.  Since
then I have mostly worked in retail management,
however, I have also worked as a cellphone technician 
for Verizon and in sales at Agile Global Outsourcing.
I learned how to code in Salesforce for my position 
at A.G.O. but did not pursue certification.

Two years ago my brother who worked in the IT 
industry was murdered and he had always wanted me to
pick up coding again as it is something I enjoy
and excell at, and he had hoped we could some day
work together.  I had always figured I would have time
to do it in the future, but his time was cut short.
So, now I am on a personal mission to code.  Since I
began this effort in the middle of September 2020
(three and a half months ago) I have earned two
certificates in coding Python and I am currently
working on a third with my eyes set on earning at
least 5 certifications in the coming year and developing 
at least one app and getting it on the google play store.

Vicariously, through my brother, I have gotten to
interact with the wonderful community that is 
Information Technology professionals, and I look forward
to interacting, networking, and collaborating with 
you all in the coming months and years.

Thank You
